# DSC-Envisalink

Allows a DSC security panel with Envisalink to integrate into SmartThings. Requires the use of Alarmserver running on any server, Envisalink module connected to a DSC security panel, and the SmartThings App.

This integration is mostly complete and working, but some items do not work as SmartThings still has issues with custom capabilities and switches.
