# DSC-Envisalink

This allows the a DSC security panel with Envisalink to integrate into SmartThings Requires the use of Alarmserver running on any server, Envisalink module connected to a DSC security panel, and SmartThings App.

This integration is mostly complete and working, but I still consider it in a beta stage, as SmartThings still has issues with custom capabilities.
